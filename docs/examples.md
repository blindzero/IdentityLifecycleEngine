# Examples

Runnable examples live in the repository under `examples/`.

- `examples/run-demo.ps1` – end-to-end demo (Plan → Execute) with a host-provided Step Registry
- `examples/workflows/` – workflow definition samples (`.psd1`)

## Run the demo

From the repository root:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\examples\run-demo.ps1
```

The demo prints the execution status and a small event table.
