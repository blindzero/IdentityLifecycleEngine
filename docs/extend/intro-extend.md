This section explains how to **extend IdLE**.
IdLE is designed for change through modules instead of forks.

It is written for people who want to add or customize functionality, for example:

- writing new providers,
- adding new steps,
- integrating with secret stores,
- emitting events to sinks,
- building reusable workflow templates.

## What you will find here

- Architectural extension points (core vs. steps vs. providers)
- Provider contracts and capabilities
- Step design principles (idempotency, validation, fail-fast)
- Authentication and session handling
- Testing approaches (unit tests, contract tests)

## Not the right section?

If you want to run workflows as an operator/admin, go to [Use Idle](../use/intro-use.md) instead.
