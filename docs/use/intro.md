with one or more providers.

## What you will find here

- Planning versus execution
- Running workflows
- Exporting plans for review and audit
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Where to continue?

2. [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
3. [Workflows](workflows.md)
4. [Plan Export](plan-export.md)

## Not the right section?

If you want to extend IdLE and implement providers or steps, go to [Extend](../extend/intro.md) instead.
