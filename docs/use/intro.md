with one or more providers.

## What you will find here

- Installing and updating IdLE
- Define workflows
- Planning versus execution
- Running workflows
- Exporting plans for review and audit
- Executing workflow plans

If you want to extend IdLE and implement providers or steps, go to [Extend](../extend/intro.md) instead.
