# IdentityLifecycleEngine (IdLE)

![IdLE Logo](/assets/idle_logo_flat_white_text_small.png)

IdLE is a **generic, headless, configuration-driven** lifecycle orchestration engine
for identity and account processes (Joiner / Mover / Leaver), built for **PowerShell 7+**.

IdLE focuses on:

- **Portability**: run in different environments without a hard dependency on a specific host or UI.
- **Testability**: deterministic planning, mockable providers, and strong contracts.
- **Modularity**: a small core and pluggable steps/providers.
- **Configurability**: workflows are defined as data, not code.
