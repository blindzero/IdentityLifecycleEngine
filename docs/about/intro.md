# IdentityLifecycleEngine (IdLE)

![IdLE Logo](/assets/idle_logo_flat_white_text_small.png)

IdLE is a **generic, headless, configuration-driven** lifecycle orchestration engine
for identity and account processes (Joiner / Mover / Leaver), built for **PowerShell 7+**.

IdLE focuses on:

- **Portability**: run in different environments without a hard dependency on a specific host or UI.
- **Testability**: deterministic planning, mockable providers, and strong contracts.
- **Modularity**: a small core and pluggable providers and steps.
- **Configurability**: workflows are defined as data, not code.

## Where to go next

- [Use](../use/intro.md): install IdLE, run workflows, export plans, troubleshoot.
- [Extend](../extend/intro.md): implement providers and steps, integrate with secrets and events.
- [Reference](../reference/intro.md): cmdlets, steps, capabilities, and specifications.
